2.0 How to install BingoX:

	Installing BingoX should be a fairly simple process. Download the the
	latest distriubtion, make, and install. Then setup the configuration files (see below.)

2.1 Putting everything in the right place:

	Download a copy of BingoX-current.tar.gz. From the directory BingoX is
	downloaded to do the following to extract the files and install them.

	[thai@lava apps]# gunzip -c BingoX-current.tar.gz | tar -xf -
	[thai@lava apps]# cd BingoX-1.90
	[thai@lava BingoX-1.90]# cd perl Makefile.PL
	[thai@lava BingoX-1.90]# make
	[thai@lava BingoX-1.90]# make install

2.2 Setting up the configuration files:

	The example configuration file is: "conf/bingox.conf.template".  You can 
	copy this file to "bingox.conf" or make a symbolic link to it in your 
	webserver conf directory.

	DocumentRoot   (Apache Directive)	- the path to your HTML/XPML pages
	SERVER_ROOT	   (Environment var)	- the path to your webserver root diretory
	AdminMainIndex (PerlSetVar)			- the main Admin Index page

	Setup DBI string
	ie. "dbi:Sybase:database=bingox_db;server=bingox_server", 'bingox', 'bingox'
	dbi				= [ Sybase | Pg | Oracle ]
	database		= [ DATABASE ]
	username		= [ USERNAME ]
	password		= [ PASSWORD ]

	PrintError		=> warns on errors
	RaiseError		=> don't die on error
	ChopBlanks		=> removes trailing blanks
	AutoCommit		=> commit executes immediately

	PerlInitHandler Apache::StatINC	- for development, doesn't require 
										webserver to be restarted for changes
	PerlSendHeader Off				- tells mod_perl not to send HTTP headers automatically
	PerlTaintCheck On				- toggles taint checking
	PerlWarn On						- toggles warnings

	Require files need for your project/application
	include [ apps/project/conf/project.conf.data ]

	Setup Files location block for *.xpml pages
	XPPIncludeDir  (PerlSetVar)	- the path to your include files directory
	XPMLHeaders	   (PerlSetVar)	- the header file(s) that are included at the top of any XPML pages
	XPMLFooters	   (PerlSetVar)	- the footer file(s) that are included at the bottom of any XPML pages

3.0	Require bingox.conf in httpd.conf

	"Include /home/www/apps/BingoX/conf/bingox.conf", or use the path to your 
	bingox.conf file.

3.1	Restart the webserver

4.0	Disclaimer

	This release was developed and tested using version 5.005_03 
	built for i386-linux.

	Please contact me if you use this for anything non-trivial.  
	This is not for permission, it's so I can get some idea of 
	what folks are using the package for other than trivial scripts.
